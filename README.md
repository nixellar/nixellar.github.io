# What is nixellar?
#### Nixellar is a portmanteau of "NIX+STELLAR".
"Nixellar" is nothing but the 'tokenized' "NIX" on the "Stellar blockchain". 

#### About us:
We are an aspiring federation, server anchor and ghostnode operator, on the Stellar Network and the NIX platform, respectively.
Currently, we provide a 'manual swap' between the Stellar Asset 'NIX' issued by "G...i" and 'native NIX' of the NIX platform.
This means, you can change your "NIX" into a "Stellar Asset" an trade it effortlessly with Thousands of other blockchain assets, including Bitcoin, Tether, XRP, SLT, Gold, Platinum, Silver, Photons, etc. in an 'actual' and 'liquid' world reknowned DEX (Decentalized EXchange).

## How to:

Open a fresh issue on "github.com/nixellar/requests/issues" to begin the swap procedure.
Alternatively, you can also e-Mail us on "nixellar" at "protonmail" dot "com" with your request.

Fill in the issue template or the e-Mail as follows::
