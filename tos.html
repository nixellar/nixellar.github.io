<h2 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h2>

<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We are not liable for any loss of funds.</li>
  <li>We are not responsible for user mistakes.</li>
  <li>We can not reverse a transaction or swap.</li>
  <li>Cryptocurrency trading is a high risk activity.</li>
  <li>Please triple-check your addresses before transacting.</li>
  <li>Please count the number of zeroes before sending transactions.</li>
  <li>This service is not responsible for change in valuation of either currency.</li>
  <li>We only tokenize the ‘NIX’ on the ‘SDEX’ for increasing liquidity and inceasing trading alternatives.</li>
  <li>This servive is provided on an ‘as is’ basis and thereby contitutes no “warranty” of any kind since all actions are final and unchangeable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="n̲o̲t̲e̲">N̲O̲T̲E̲:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Both [ NIX ⇨ XLM ] and [ NIX ⇦ XLM ] are supported.</li>
  <li>This is a manual process and may take upto 7 business days.</li>
  <li>This service requires you to own your private keys because the user needs to send the transactions himself from his own account.</li>
  <li>We support ‘memos’ on the Stellar blockchain for “tipbots” or “cryptocurrency-exchanges” for withdrawals and deposits. This is not encouraged and not recommended. Please prefer to use an address that is only owned by the you, the user.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="asset-supply">Asset supply:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We will not issue ‘Assets’ for ‘NIX’ that we do not hold.</li>
  <li>One can measure the current level of tokenization by checking the “Trust Limit” set by the issuing address “G…i”.</li>
  <li>For every ‘NIX’ deposited in our “Nixellar-NIX-deposit-address”, will will issue the depositer an equal amount of “NIX-asset” to their stellar address.</li>
  <li>Tokens recieved back by the ‘distribution address’ “G…d” or the ‘issuing address’ “G…i” will burned simultaneously by returning to the issuer (G…i) and lowering the trust limit simultaneously to prevent their further circulation. This decreases the supply.</li>
  <li>In technical terms, this means our C.R.R. (Credit-Reserve Ratio) will always be no less than 1 (unity). On contrast, your Central bank mandates your Local bank to maintain a C.R.R. of about 1 to 10% on a good day. On a bad day, it falls to ‘near zero’ levels.</li>
  <li>There can never be more than 102,210,160 NIX in total. Their circulation supply is governed by the ‘Nix Protocol’, and can be queried by running a node of NIX platform. One is run by the creators and approximate data is provided on data.nixplatform.io webpage in real time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ceasation-clause">Ceasation clause:</h3>
<p>In an unfortunate event of termination of this service:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will stop changing ‘NIX’ into “NIX issued by G…i” on the Stellar blockchain.</li>
  <li>We will be liable for all and any outstanding tokens on the Stellar blockchain for upto 1 year from the time of cessation of operations.</li>
  <li>We will allow for a period of 1 year to return the “NIX-Asset” to the issuing address ‘G…i’.</li>
  <li>All tokens will be returned 1:1, minus the “Nixellar fee” to their respective ‘Nix-platform’ addresses, if they originated from one.</li>
  <li>All remaining tokens will be bought back from the SDEX by the distribution address “G…d” and burned simultaneously by returning to the issuer and lowering the trust limit simultaneously to prevent their further circulation.</li>
